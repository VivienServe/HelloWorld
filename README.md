einfach ein Test

Hi, I'm Vivien and I don't have any clue, what to do here, so I'm still testing.
I hope one time, I'll find a real profession, which suits to me, my character an my wishes.
But IT or Computer Science is not really what I want to do, cause there a too much people which are
much better than me. Also, I got a boyfriend that is really good in what he's doing. And guess what he's doing: IT System Engineering
